Welcome to the Common Data Model Builder tutorial!

Before we get started, let's make sure we meet the following requirements:

- You have an internet connection.
- Be logged in with your Google account.

If everything is OK, let's continue! 

In this tutorial, we are going to use a Jupyter Notebook.

Available at the following URL:

https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA/blob/main/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA.ipynb

ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”® To open the Notebook in Google Colab add the URL "tocolab" at the end of "GitHub". Click on the following link ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®

https://githubtocolab.com/cienciadedatosysalud/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA/blob/main/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA.ipynb 

Once we are in Google Colab, we make sure we are connected to the Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend (top right of the screen). 

In case we are not connected, we select connect to get a result as in the image.

Now we are ready to follow the instructions that appear in the notebook.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜„

# Funding
Several grants have contributed to the development of the Common Data Model Builder (cdmb) including CONCEPT-STROKE (Grant reference: PI19/00154) financed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII, Spain) within the Health Research and Development Strategy (AES), the Horizon2020 PHIRI - Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (Grant NÂº 101018317), and the HorizonEurope BY-COVID - Beyond COVID (Grant NÂº 101046203). The initiative has also received support from the Health Outcomes-Oriented Cooperative Research Networks (RICORS) on Research Networks in Chronicity, Primary Care, and Health Promotion (RICAPPS) (Grant reference: RD21/0016/0016) funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) in the 2021 call of the Strategic Action in Health 2017-2020, charged to the European funds of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.

This workshop showcased the use of 'cdmb' library and app developed in CONCEPT using both CONCEPT-STROKE, PHIRI and BY-COVID use cases as examples.
